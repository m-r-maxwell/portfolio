Over the course of 2023 I dipped my toes into more serious game development.  However, I started off with Unity before deciding to pivot to using Godot 4 and using GDScript instead of using C#.
The game ended up being a 2D sprite-based game using assets from Kenney Tiny Dungeon as well as music that was in the public domain.
I gained some notable animation design experience from this project, as I did do all of the animations myself using Godot’s inbuilt animation player.
The GitHub repo is [Tiny Arena](https://www.github.com/m-r-maxwell/tinyarena). If you want to try playing it, the game is not really balanced and was more so an exercise in game development. I have another idea that I want to work on in the future. This project was also developed on a Mac, so I’m not sure how it would build on Windows. I would highly encourage looking up the Godot docs.
Here is a quick demo of the game in action…

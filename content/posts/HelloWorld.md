# Hello World!

This is a personal blog and portfolio website that will be hosted on github pages until I get more comfortable and turn it in to a full website.

This was made with Hugo as it was something I wanted to learn. I'll add projects to it over time that can be found [here](/projects) I have also been experting with cooking as it helps me feel creative and it might even end up on here at some point as a sub blog. It's interesting to think about, programming is an extension of creativity and I don't think people explore other creative outlets enough.

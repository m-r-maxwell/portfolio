Over the course of 2023 I dipped my toes in to more serious game development, however I started off with Unity before deciding to pivot to using Godot 4 and using gdscript instead of using C#.

The game ended up being a 2D sprite based game using assessts from kenney tiny dungeons as well as music that was under free use.

Some notible experience from this was animation design, since I did do all of the animations myself using Godot's inbuilt animation player.

The github repo is [Tiny Arena](https://github.com/m-r-maxwell/tinyarena). If you end up wanting to try playing it, the game is not really balanced and was more so just for game development experience for another idea I have that I want to work on in the future. It was also developed on a Mac so not sure how it would build on windows. I would highly encourage looking up the Godot docs.

Here is a quick demo of the game in action...

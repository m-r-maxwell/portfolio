# Hello World!

This is a personal blog and portfolio website currently hosted on GitHub pages. My goal is to develop my skills and turn it into a full website hosted on something like Azure Static Sites.
This was created with Hugo, a new tool I recently challenged myself to learn. I’ll add projects to it over time that can be found [here](/projects). I have also been expanding my cooking skills which I find helps me feel creative.  Some of those experiments may also end up on here at some point as a sub blog. I find programming to be an extension of my creativity.  I don’t think people explore other creative outlets enough.
Last thing of major note for now is that this was also set up to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

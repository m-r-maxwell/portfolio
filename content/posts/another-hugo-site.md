Hi there!

It has been awhile but I am still going to maintain and add to this, but recently I have been traveling and I started a new job so that has been keeping me somewhat busy. However I decided I wanted to make a specific recipe website for recipes I've made or found online with a focus on meal prepping since that has quickly become my preferred way of cooking. When it is live I will come back here and add a link to it directly. It will also be like this where for now it will be hosted on GitHub Pages until I get around to finding a good way to host this website. Ideally it would be something like self-hosting  like how Dreams of Code is doing some of his stuff, however I am fair bit away of setting up a home lab like that.

One of the earliest projects I worked on was recreating space invaders since it was one of my favorite games when I was a kid. I'm not super surprsied it was one of my earliest projects since I think most people who end up in software at some point end up meddling with game development.

This was made in python using pygame.

Here is the repo link [Space-Invaders](https://github.com/m-r-maxwell/space-invaders/tree/master)

And here is a sample of the game.

It could be made better by writing to a text file or a database to keep track of the high scores, but when I intiailly made this I did not do a whole lot of work with databases.
